# WS-69 Evidence (2026-02-27)

WS-69 goal: land Scope B as a bounded Python operational hardening review scope for matrix/runtime/release stability.

## Scope Basis

Bounded file membership is defined in:

- `docs/WS67_SCOPE_PLAN_2026-02-27.md`

Scope B covers:

- container testbed image bootstrap hardening
- offline matrix workspace execution hardening
- secrets-check false-positive suppression for deterministic journals
- SBOM generator pinning and regression coverage

## Validation

Secrets gate:

```bash
./scripts/check_secrets.sh
```

Result:

- `[secrets] clean.`

SBOM gates:

```bash
make sbom
make sbom-verify
```

Result:

- `[sbom] ok: path=sbom.cyclonedx.json spec=1.6 components=51 foxclaw_version=0.1.0`

Focused Scope B regression pack:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_container_matrix_bootstrap.py tests/test_sbom.py
```

Result:

- `7 passed`

Full baseline regression:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

Result:

- `265 passed, 7 skipped`

## Reconciliation Outcome

- Scope B behavior is already implemented and validated.
- WS-69 therefore resolves as a status-reconciliation and evidence slice, not a new behavior implementation slice.
- Queue can advance to Scope C (`WS-70`).
