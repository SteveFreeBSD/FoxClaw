# WS-73 Evidence (2026-02-27)

WS-73 goal: make agent checkpoint persistence local-only so repository pushes do not publish workflow history or internal notes.

## Scope

- move session-memory journal/doc defaults from tracked `docs/` files to ignored `artifacts/session_memory/`
- remove tracked `docs/SESSION_MEMORY.jsonl` and `docs/SESSION_MEMORY.md`
- keep memory recall tooling functional via local-only storage and deterministic override support

## Validation

Focused privacy regression:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_session_memory_privacy.py
```

Result:

- `2 passed`

Local memory command smoke:

```bash
python scripts/session_memory.py show
python scripts/memory_index.py update
```

Result:

- latest checkpoint reads from local-only `artifacts/session_memory/`
- index builds at `artifacts/session_memory/index.sqlite`

Full baseline regression:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

Result:

- `267 passed, 7 skipped`

## Residual Risk

- Removing the files from the current tree does not erase older commits that already contain them.
- If public history scrubbing is required, that must be handled separately with a deliberate history-rewrite process.
