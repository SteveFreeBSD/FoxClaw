# Ecosystem Research Snapshot - 2026-02-20

This snapshot compares FoxClaw against active adjacent projects and data sources as of **February 20, 2026**.

## Comparable Projects and Feeds

| Area | Current 2026 Signal | Relevance to FoxClaw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firefox hardening baselines | Arkenfox latest release shown as `v140-1` (2025-11-03); Betterfox latest release shown as `146.0` (2025-12-13). | Confirms active baseline-curation ecosystem; FoxClaw rules should maintain import/mapping compatibility. |
| Mozilla vulnerability intelligence | Firefox known-vulnerabilities page lists 2026 advisories with fixed versions (example: fixed in `147.0.4` and `140.7.1`). | Validates FoxClaw Phase 2 direction: pinned advisory correlation from local snapshot data. |
| Firefox enterprise policy surface | Enterprise policy docs updated 2026-01-26 and include policy areas such as `GenerativeAI`, `Extensions`, `ExtensionSettings`, etc. | Policy-key coverage must stay current; policy checks should be expanded against official policy surface changes. |
| Extension analysis tooling | `web-ext` latest release shown as `8.9.0` (2026-02-10). `addons-linter` latest release shown as `9.6.0` (2026-02-10). | FoxClaw extension posture rules are useful, but deeper static extension checks remain an integration opportunity. |
| Endpoint/fleet query model | osquery latest release shown as `5.20.0` (2025-10-23); Fleet publishes normalized `firefox_addons` table schema. | Aligns with FoxClaw Phase 3 fleet output goals; suggests stable aggregation contract design. |
| Exploitability and CVE feeds | CISA KEV JSON generated `2026-02-19`; NVD JSON feed metadata updated `2026-02-20`; CVE list v5 repository has current 2026-tagged releases. | Strongly supports roadmap sequence for KEV/NVD/CVE enrichment in explicit sync phase. |

## Roadmap Alignment Assessment

### Strongly Aligned

- Offline-by-default scan runtime with explicit sync phase.
- Deterministic snapshot and diff workflow.
- Pinned-snapshot intel correlation design.

### Partially Aligned

- Extension intelligence: baseline blocklist correlation now exists, but broader reputation/AMO metadata correlation remains incomplete.
- CI/release hardening: parity gates are now enforced, while provenance/attestation controls remain in backlog.

### Misalignment Risk

- Any use of plaintext HTTP intel mirrors remains a governance risk and should stay explicit/auditable.

### Required Follow-Through

- Track and execute the ordered remediation/expansion plan in `docs/WORKSLICES.md`.
