# WS-70 Evidence (2026-02-27)

WS-70 goal: land the docs/evidence/queue-control pack that closes the bounded Python scope sequence before merge execution.

## Scope Basis

Bounded file membership for the docs/evidence pack was defined in:

- `docs/WS67_SCOPE_PLAN_2026-02-27.md`

This slice reconciles:

- workslice queue state
- pre-merge queue control
- roadmap sequencing between the Python source-of-truth baseline and deferred Rust branch work

## Reconciliation Outcome

- Scope C documentation is now aligned with the validated Scope A and Scope B evidence.
- The bounded Python scope sequence is explicitly closed in the queue.
- The next post-scope action is `WS-71`, a merge-execution checkpoint that keeps Rust bootstrap blocked until the Python baseline is merged cleanly.

## Validation

Full baseline regression:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

Result:

- `265 passed, 7 skipped`
