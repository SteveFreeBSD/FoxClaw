# WS-74 Evidence (2026-02-27)

WS-74 goal: restore Python-first execution ordering so production hardening and SIEM-readiness work complete before Rust resumes.

## Reconciliation Outcome

- Rust bootstrap is no longer the immediate next slice.
- `WS-75` now owns Python production hardening and battle-test expansion on `main`.
- `WS-76` now owns Python SIEM-readiness preparation before any Rust port decisions resume.
- `WS-31` and `WS-32` remain deferred to `rust/ws31-bootstrap`, but only after the Python production/siem slices are complete.

## Validation

Full baseline regression:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

Result:

- `267 passed, 7 skipped`
