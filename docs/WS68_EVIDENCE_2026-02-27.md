# WS-68 Evidence (2026-02-27)

WS-68 goal: land Scope A as a bounded Python feature review scope for WS-47..WS-54 threat-surface expansion and generator parity.

## Scope Basis

Bounded file membership is defined in:

- `docs/WS67_SCOPE_PLAN_2026-02-27.md`

Scope A covers:

- artifact collectors and artifact serialization for WS-47..WS-54
- rules DSL/ruleset support for those findings
- Python/Windows adversary and generator parity coverage
- direct regression tests for cookies, HSTS, session/search/certificates/rules integration, and generator round-trips

## Validation

Focused Scope A regression pack:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q \
  tests/test_adversary_profiles_script.py \
  tests/test_cookies.py \
  tests/test_hsts.py \
  tests/test_profile_artifacts.py \
  tests/test_rules_m3.py \
  tests/test_session.py \
  tests/test_snapshot_m5.py \
  tests/test_windows_auth_gen_scripts.py
```

Result:

- `63 passed, 7 skipped`

Full baseline regression:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

Result:

- `265 passed, 7 skipped`

## Reconciliation Outcome

- Scope A behavior is already implemented and validated.
- WS-68 therefore resolves as a status-reconciliation and evidence slice, not a new behavior implementation slice.
- Queue can advance to Scope B (`WS-69`).
