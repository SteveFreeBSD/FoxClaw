# WS-66 Evidence (2026-02-27)

WS-66 goal: prove the Python implementation is the clean source of truth before any Rust branch work begins.

## Gate Results

1. Base certification

```bash
./scripts/certify.sh
```

Result: pass

2. Live-profile certification

```bash
./scripts/certify.sh --with-live-profile --profile tests/fixtures/firefox_profile
```

Result: pass

- live diff drift_detected: `False`
- live diff added/removed/changed: `0 0 0`

3. Dependency audit

```bash
make dep-audit
```

Result: pass

- `packages_with_vulns=0`
- `vulnerabilities_total=0`

4. Packaging dry-run and install smoke

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m build
.venv/bin/python -m twine check dist/*
python3 -m venv "<tmp>/venv"
"<tmp>/venv/bin/pip" install dist/*.whl
"<tmp>/venv/bin/foxclaw" --help
```

Result: pass

5. SBOM generation and verification

```bash
make sbom
make sbom-verify
```

Result: pass

- `spec=1.6`
- `components=51`
- `foxclaw_version=0.1.0`

6. Short soak confidence pass

```bash
scripts/soak_runner.sh \
  --duration-hours 1 \
  --max-cycles 1 \
  --integration-runs 1 \
  --snapshot-runs 1 \
  --synth-count 2 \
  --synth-mode bootstrap \
  --synth-seed 424242 \
  --synth-mutation-budget 0 \
  --synth-fidelity-min-score 70 \
  --require-launch-gate \
  --launch-gate-min-score 50 \
  --fuzz-count 2 \
  --fuzz-mode chaos \
  --fuzz-seed 525252 \
  --fuzz-mutation-budget 1 \
  --fuzz-fidelity-min-score 50 \
  --adversary-runs 1 \
  --adversary-count 1 \
  --matrix-runs 1 \
  --label ws66-premerge
```

Result: pass

- run dir: `/var/tmp/foxclaw-soak/20260227T135950Z-ws66-premerge`
- `cycles_completed=1`
- `steps_total=16`
- `steps_failed=0`
- `overall_status=PASS`

## Findings Review

- No residual product failures were observed in the short soak.
- The previously observed overnight matrix failures were infrastructure/bootstrap drift in the container lane, not Python scan logic regressions.
- After container bootstrap hardening, ESR, beta, and nightly matrix scan lanes all passed in the short soak.

## Merge Recommendation

- Python is gate-clean and remains the canonical source of truth.
- Do not merge the current worktree as a single unit yet.
- Reason: the repository still contains mixed in-flight changes from multiple slices and review scopes; those changes should be isolated into coherent commits or PRs before merge.
