# Testbed

FoxClaw uses a layered Firefox testbed strategy:

- deterministic fixture matrix (`tests/fixtures/testbed/`) for integration tests.
- local live profile smoke testing via `make certify-live`.
- optional containerized real Firefox smoke lane for scheduled coverage.

## Deterministic Fixture Matrix

Fixtures are generated by:

```bash
python scripts/generate_testbed_fixtures.py --write
```

Validate fixture integrity and manifest drift:

```bash
python scripts/generate_testbed_fixtures.py --check
git diff --quiet -- tests/fixtures/testbed
```

Run integration tests:

```bash
python scripts/generate_testbed_fixtures.py --write
pytest -q -m integration
```

`--write` is required before integration tests on fresh clones because Git does not preserve non-executable mode details (`0600` vs `0644`), and permission scenarios are part of the matrix.

## Scenario Profiles

- `profile_baseline`: valid prefs and SQLite, strict file modes, no policy override.
- `profile_weak_perms`: relaxed `key4.db` permissions to trigger filesystem HIGH findings.
- `profile_sqlite_error`: corrupted `places.sqlite` to trigger SQLite HIGH findings.
- `profile_policy_present`: policy override path includes `policies.DisableTelemetry`.
- `profile_active_lock`: `parent.lock` present for `--require-quiet-profile` validation.
- `profile_userjs_override`: `prefs.js` + `user.js` overlap to validate user.js precedence.

Ruleset for integration scenarios:

- `tests/fixtures/testbed/rulesets/integration.yml`

Policy fixture path used by tests:

- `tests/fixtures/testbed/policies/disable_telemetry.json`

## Policy Path Override

The CLI supports deterministic policy-path injection:

```bash
foxclaw scan \
  --profile tests/fixtures/testbed/profile_policy_present \
  --ruleset tests/fixtures/testbed/rulesets/integration.yml \
  --policy-path tests/fixtures/testbed/policies/disable_telemetry.json \
  --json
```

When one or more `--policy-path` values are supplied, FoxClaw scans only those paths.

## Optional Containerized Firefox Smoke

Run locally (Docker required):

```bash
make test-firefox-container
```

This builds `docker/testbed/Dockerfile`, launches Firefox headless to generate a real profile, runs a scan, and writes artifacts to `firefox-container-artifacts/`.

Equivalent compose workflow:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/testbed/docker-compose.yml run --rm firefox-esr-smoke
```
