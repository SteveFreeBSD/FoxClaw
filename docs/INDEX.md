## Assurance Packet

- Packet entrypoint and read order: `../CTO_PACKET_INDEX.md`
- One-page assurance summary: `../FOXCLAW_ASSURANCE_SUMMARY.md`
- Gap and risk framing: `../POSTURE_2026_GAP_REPORT.md`

## Rule

When documentation conflicts:
1. `docs/CLI_CONTRACT.md` governs CLI behavior.
2. `docs/WORKSLICES.md` governs status/order.
3. `docs/ROADMAP.md` governs phase strategy.
